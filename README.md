# security-log-analyzer
## Overview
A Python-based application designed to automate the analysis of system and application logs to identify suspicious activity and potential security incidents. This project simulates real-world SOC workflows by detecting anomalies such as brute-force log-in attempts, abnormal access patterns, and high-risk IP-behavior.

## Why This Project Matters?
Organizations generate massive volumes of logs that are often reviewed manually or reactively. This tool demonstrates how security automation can: 
- Reduce incident respone times.
- Improve threat visibility.
- Support compliance and audit readiness.

## Key Features
- Parses authentication and access logs.
- Detects brute-force and anomaly patterns.
- Aggregates suspicious IP activity.
- Generates structured reports (CSV/JSON)
- REST API for querying flagged events.
